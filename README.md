# Library Management System

This project, undertaken for the Embedded Systems (CPE16) course, involved the development of a library management system specifically designed for the Laguna State Polytechnic University College of Engineering. The primary objective was to gain practical experience in embedded systems development, specifically exploring the interplay between hardware and software components. 

**System Architecture:**

* **Microprocessor:** The core of the system utilized a Raspberry Pi single-board computer, serving as the central processing unit. 
* **Sensors:**
  * An RFID reader was employed as the primary sensor for user authentication, leveraging the existing RFID tags embedded in the student and faculty IDs.
    * RFID stickers were affixed to each book, enabling the system to identify and track individual library items.
* **Database:** SQLite was chosen as the database management system, providing a lightweight and efficient solution for storing and retrieving system data.
* **Software:** The system was programmed in Python, utilizing the tkinter library to create a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) for interaction.

**Key Features:**

* **User Authentication:** RFID reader-based authentication enabled secure access to system functionalities.
* **Book Inventory Management:** [Describe specific features, e.g., book borrowing/returning, book searches, overdue book tracking]
* **User Management:** [Describe features, e.g., user registration, profile management, access control]
* **[Add other key features, if applicable]**

**Learning Outcomes:**

* **Embedded Systems Fundamentals:** Gained practical experience in working with a microprocessor (Raspberry Pi) and integrating hardware (RFID reader) with software.
* **Database Management:** Learned to utilize SQLite for data storage and retrieval, implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for efficient data management.
* **Python Programming:** Enhanced proficiency in Python programming, including GUI development using the tkinter library and database interaction with SQLite.
* **System Design and Development:** Developed a comprehensive understanding of the system design process, from conceptualization and hardware selection to software implementation and testing.
* **[Add other learning outcomes]**
